## disclaimer
I decided for draft A out of pure interest in sociolinguistic and register/style aspects of language. I see now that it's maybe not enough associated to structural or systemic aspects covered in class. So I intend to propose 2 more essais:

- B: AI and language development: The influence of new media on the fixation of language.
- C: xtitle: The choice of english L1/L2 structures in german >L1 speakers. A corpus based investigation of english language patterns in german term papers of exchange students.
