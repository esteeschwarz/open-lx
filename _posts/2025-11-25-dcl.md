## dahlem center for linguistics site proposal

- CMS backend based on github workflow
- why:
    - FU CMS used (wordpress + single sign on) forces users to use wordpress UI or worst case deliver finalised content which authenticated users then post to database > this could prevent users to continually work on posts or post content actively
    - github offers several static (=no DB needed) approaches to allow unlimited users to create content based on simple .csv tables or .md or plain texts which then are rendered to html frontend which is dependent on framework more or less customizable
- caveats:
    - public data storage
    - anyone with access can edit anything / admins have to keep track of organisation users

### preliminary
- target group
- who writes
    - with what capacities
        - technical
        - scientifically
        - time effort
    - whats her use purpose of the center page
        - landing page for individually set up project page
            - with only project abstract
        - complete project presentation
            - needs to implement complex built paper?
            - standard paper layout?
        - user interaction needed?
            - > blog format
        - number of metadata to be included and how displayed?

## live
the first essai proposal you see with precisely THIS site. this could be an option and its live playing along the possible frameworks.

### jekyll
the landing page here is rendered by jekyll from simple markdown. this is done automatically via a github action everytime the content changes.

### quarto
many of the single essais presented here as blog entries are rendered as single site from quarto (also markdown) documents.

## proceed
the jekyll theme used on this site is **Chirpy**.  
we try out another theme **feeling-responsive** 

- [here](https://esteeschwarz.github.io/DC-LX/linguistics/dcl/), 

based on **foundation** which seems also the base style for the wordpress theme used by the FU pages.
