# Introduction

In this paper, we explore the question of authenticity in literary representation and the role of politically incorrect terminology in preserving historical voice.

# Discussion

When analyzing figures in literature, we must distinguish between authorial narration and character speech. Authenticity arises when characters express themselves as they would have within their social and temporal context.

# Conclusion

Censorship of language may risk erasing traces of real social discourse, transforming literature into a sanitized reflection of ideology rather than experience.
